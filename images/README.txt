IMAGES HAVE BEEN MOVED

The images for the LARO Basketball Community website have been moved to the static/img folder.
Please use the static/img folder for all image assets going forward.

REQUIRED IMAGES FOR LARO LANDING PAGE:

1. hero-player.png - A basketball player image for the hero section
2. play-friends.png - Image showing people playing basketball together
3. competitive.png - Image showing competitive basketball
4. potential.png - Image showing basketball potential/skills

For best results:

- Ensure images have good contrast against the yellow background
- Optimize images for web to keep file sizes small

This folder is kept for backward compatibility but may be removed in the future.
